  <h2>Reflection Essay</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      Through this website portfolio, I have grown as a designer and coder. Each project taught me unique lessons. Initially, coding felt like a very complex and structured language to me. However, after learning from school lectures and working on coding worksheets, I started to understand the art and logic behind web development. In this reflection, I will go through all the essential parts of my learning process, the challenges I solved, and the improvements I made.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The first challenge I faced was understanding the logic of HTML and CSS. These foundational technologies may seem basic, but as I delved deeper into their elements, functions, and structures, I realized their intricacy. Trial and error helped me grasp these concepts, and sketching layouts taught me the importance of planning before coding. By addressing user needs, I created functional and visually appealing designs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      GitHub was another key skill I developed. Learning how to create repositories, manage commits, and work with branches felt overwhelming at first. Over time, GitHub became a vital tool for saving my work, documenting progress, and collaborating effectively. It also provided a detailed record of my growth and allowed me to refine my projects iteratively.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      CSS taught me the importance of user experience. Adding hover effects, styling buttons, and designing responsive layouts were transformative experiences. For example, using hover effects to reveal text overlays on images added interactivity to my projects. Experimenting with flexbox and grid layouts improved my understanding of alignment and positioning, helping me create designs that were both functional and attractive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Project 2 introduced me to the CARP (Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity) principles in design. Applying these principles transformed the aesthetics and functionality of my posters. For example, using contrasting lines and subtle backgrounds ensured key text stood out, while maintaining visual harmony. This project helped me recognize how fundamental design principles can create impactful visuals.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Project 3 focused on typography, a vital aspect of design. Through this project, I experimented with font pairings, text hierarchies, and alignment. Each design element contributed to crafting a seamless and engaging user experience. For instance, designing radial and modular layouts taught me how text can guide a readerâ€™s attention effectively while maintaining readability.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Throughout this process, I faced various challenges, including debugging errors and overcoming self-doubt. Each error message provided an opportunity to learn patience and develop problem-solving skills. These challenges not only strengthened my coding abilities but also built my resilience as a designer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In conclusion, my coding journey has been a valuable and transformative experience. It has taught me to think critically, embrace challenges, and approach learning with determination. From designing posters and text layouts to exploring advanced coding techniques, each project has contributed to my growth as both a coder and designer. I look forward to building on these foundations to create more impactful digital experiences in the future.
